{"name":"Open Social Networking","tagline":"A place for developers, and users to discuss open social networking.","body":"We believe that all of the features and experiences of the big social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc) can and should be provided in a way that embraces the open internet. No one app/service can do it alone, join us in helping make the social networks of tomorrow more open for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Join the Conversation\r\n\r\n[Join our mailing list &#8594;](http://brianschrader.us12.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=e1625e70fb7caf94a6fb56d62&id=5b381d22d1)\r\n\r\nEven though we mainly chat on the mailing list, we also have an IRC chat! Join us at `chat.freenode.com` in `#OpenSocialNetworking`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nThose who contribute to Open Social Networking (either on the mailing list, site issues, or in the chat) are part of a community intended for learning, and collaboration and has members with different backgrounds and perspectives.\r\n\r\nDiversity is a huge strength, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to organizers as well as members.\r\n\r\nThis isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\r\n\r\nThis code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Open Social Networking. This includes IRC, mailing lists, and events. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.\r\n\r\n### Be friendly and patient.\r\n\r\n### Be welcoming.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\r\n\r\n### Be respectful.\r\n\r\nNot all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Contributors should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside of the community.\r\n\r\n### Be careful\r\n\r\nWords have meaning; choose the ones you use carefully. We are a community of members with a wide range of backgrounds, but we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members.\r\n\r\nHarassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nViolent threats or language directed against another person. Discriminatory jokes and language.\r\n\r\nPosting sexually explicit or violent material.\r\n\r\nPosting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\r\n\r\nPersonal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.\r\n\r\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\r\n\r\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\r\n\r\nRepeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\r\n\r\nWhen we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and we are no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes. If you have questions about this code of conduct, don't hesitate to contact the organizers.\r\n\r\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the San Diego Python User Group Code of Conduct.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
